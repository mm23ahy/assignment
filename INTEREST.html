    <p>I am particularly interested in front-end and back-end web development. I enjoy building user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and am also working with backend technologies such as Node.js and Python (Flask/Django). Building functional and interactive web applications is a huge passion of mine.</p>

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <img src="AI.webp" alt="AI" class="interest-img" width="300" height="100">
    <p>AI and machine learning have always fascinated me. I am exploring how to create intelligent systems that can learn and make predictions based on data. I have worked with Python libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch to build simple AI models, and I aim to expand my knowledge in this field.</p>
